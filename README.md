# Nordpool 'additional_cost'
Tired of calculating/changing templates for Nordpool-spot price additional cost? Look no further. This Template extension for home assistant makes additional_cost calculations easy!

By updating the correct data in this repository and updating it through HACS, my goal is that we don't have to individually update addtional_cost in our HA-instances -> one should only use HACAS to update to the last version of this template!

<br />
## Concept
Two HA-integrations fetch Nordpool-spot prices; [Nordpool](https://github.com/custom-components/nordpool) and [Priceanalyzer](https://github.com/erlendsellie/priceanalyzer). To that price there come additional costs, which contains many components that constantly seem to change :(
So when a number of state fees and power subsidy constantly cange, power transport company have night/day tarrifs, and power-broker-company change their markup,, how do you keep the actual total power-cost pr hour in your future planning?

We use this template to gather and create a good template which is updated with: 
- country level fees/subsidies
- power distributor fees/subsidies
Then the template provides some inputs (including power-broker-markup), and out you get the full price you have to pay each hour (including next-day price)

### Functions
Selected outputs for additional_cost (adjustment to net-spot (no vat) which will have to be set in nordpool/priceanalyzer
1. price for transport and broker
2. price for tarnsport, broker and subsidized spot (net)
3. price for transport, broker and subsidized spot including state fees

outputs for test/verification or to use in other sensors/calculations
11. state fees

31. transport and broker
32. price for tarnsport, broker and subsidized spot

<br />
# Requirements
1. Must have Nordpool or Priceanalyzer installed, both use same method of adding additional_Cost so they can piggyback on the cost-calculation this template (hopfully) can provide
2. HACS to get updates
3. Community focus on updating
   - There are many different countrys with separate cost-structures, and

<br />
# Installation
Install this in HACS or download the nordpool_additional_cost.jinja from this repository and place the files into your config\custom_templates directory.
PS: you need to enable HACS-experimental features (to enable downloading templates) and then select "template" when adding repository.
  
<br />
# How to use:

Create a Priceanalyzer or a Nordpool-sensor with the following as additional cost
(select the last variable as the "function" you want to return
```
{% set curr_hour = now().hour %}
{% set curr_month = now().month %}
{% set curr_price = current_price %}
{% from 'nordpool_additional_cost.jinja' import SpotTest %} 
{{ add_cost(
    curr_hour,
    curr_month,
    0.029|float/1.25,
    curr_price,
    true,
    2
    )}}
```


# How to test:

Create a Priceanalyzer or a Nordpool-sensor with nothing as additional cost
Then adjust first line in sample-template to the name of your sensor
(select the last variable as the "function" you want to return
add this code in SDevelopment tools / template, and you will get the return-value of the function you have specified.
```
{% set current_price = (states('sensor.nordpool')|float) %}
{% set curr_hour = now().hour %}
{% set curr_month = now().month %}
{% set curr_price = current_price %}
{% from 'nordpool_additional_cost.jinja' import SpotTest %} 
{{ add_cost(
    curr_hour,
    curr_month,
    0.029|float/1.25,
    curr_price,
    true,
    2
    )}}
```
